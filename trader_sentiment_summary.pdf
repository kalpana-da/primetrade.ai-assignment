Project Summary: Trader Behavior vs Bitcoin Market Sentiment

This project analyzes the relationship between market sentiment and trader behavior by merging two datasets:

     1)Historical trading data from Hyperliquid (over 200K trades)

     2)Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index (daily sentiment classification)

 Objective

To uncover how trader performance and decision-making patterns change depending on market sentiment, and to generate actionable insights that can drive smarter trading strategies in Web3 environments.

Key Findings

1️⃣ Trader Profitability is Sentiment-Driven

    Traders are most profitable during "Greed" and "Extreme Greed" periods, reflecting stronger market conditions and confident strategies.

    "Extreme Fear" periods lead to erratic and negative PnL, showing the risks of trading in emotionally distressed markets.

2️⃣ Buy/Sell Behavior Aligns with Emotion

    Buy trades dominate in bullish sentiments (Greed), suggesting entry behavior during optimism.

    Sell trades increase in Fear phases, indicating exit strategies, hedging, or panic selling.

3️⃣ Asset Preference Shifts with Sentiment

    Core assets (BTC, ETH) are traded consistently across all sentiments.

    Speculative coins are favored during Greed phases, showing risk-on behavior as sentiment improves.

4️⃣ Volume and Activity Respond to Sentiment

    Trade volume is highest during Neutral and Greed, showing that market participation correlates with emotional stability or confidence.

    Activity drops during Extreme Fear, likely due to risk aversion or indecision.

5️⃣ PnL Trends Over Time Reflect Emotional Cycles

    Daily average PnL lines show clear gains during sustained Greed, while Fear phases cluster around losses.

    This suggests that timing trades based on sentiment trends can improve performance and manage risk.

 Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates that market sentiment — quantified through the Fear & Greed Index — plays a pivotal role in shaping trader behavior across profitability, strategy, and risk-taking. Traders tend to act in emotionally consistent ways, and understanding these patterns can enhance both individual strategies and algorithmic decision systems in crypto markets.
